# Backstory

I'm currently at a phase where one realizes what role career plays in his/her life. Queue in a slew of career related documentaries and news, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what gents and ladies in this phase, spend a good chunk of their time on. It seems like everyone is either trying to grasp how to make the right career decisions or is giving out advice on how to be successful. One of the common themes that I encounter very frequently is a rather simple one - "take a risk!". In order to understand what this means, we should first consider what a **safe job** is. Not too hard to picture, is it? In fact, most of us are in our safe/cushy jobs now - A large organization, decent money, decent hours, working as one of hundreds if not thousands of others just like you doing similar if not the same thing as you. Most of us do not equate this to a 'successful career' though, at least not in our 20s. The wisdom to realize that having made it this far already qualifies us as successful, will probably hit us at around age 60 or so. But for now, this does not fit the idea of  "success" for most of us.

Enter the single most pervading theme in career advice
>"Do what you really like to do"

I wholeheartedly believe in this advice by the way, but reality is... most of us don't really know what we want to do till we're already doing something else. That **something else** being what I described above - a safe job. So what does this advice have to do with taking risks? Well, anything that requires you to move away from something that is 'safe', is a risk. So I was wondering why not just do it? Why don't people just take a leap of faith knowing that they'd be more interested in what they like and therefore perform better and be really good at it! Why not just follow your heart and do whatever you really like? Chances are that you can only give your 110% to something that you love doing as opposed to a place where you like the benefits and job security. You can only ever hope to be a mediocre at the latter, correct? I mean the logic is sound here and yet only a very small percentage of our population actually dares to move away from the safe jobs. Why?

I got the answer while I was watching a talk by [Michael Shermer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer) on self deception - [Evolution](http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shermer_the_pattern_behind_self_deception/transcript?language=en). Yes, as un-macho as that sounds, we have all evolved to be sissies. Let me see if I can explain this concept with my limited skills in the English language:

>So, say you were a specimen of our primate ancestors. You were walking down your usual path with your newly formed and awesome opposable thumb up your nose looking for that irritating booger, when you suddenly heard a rustle in the bushes close by. Now you basically have two choices - A) you can either assume that it's a predator and run for your life, or B) you can assume that it was just wind and continue on your booger hunt. 

>Depending on the reality, your decision can have two outcomes each. If the reality is that it was just wind, decision A) would make you exhausted but you'll still be alive. and decision B) would also keep you alive. If however, it was a predator, decision A) would still keep you alive but decision B) would get you killed. So, in all scenarios, the sissy decision of assuming that the rustle in the leaves is a predator and running away will keep you alive, whether you assumed correct or wrong. If you were the kind of primate that ALWAYS made decision A, and you had a friend that frequently made decision B... the chances of you surviving and procreating are a lot higher.

Scale this up and we get generation after generation of ever careful safe creatures surviving and procreating. I have been calling it a sissy decision but the truth is, depending on the time period... these were the smarter creatures. They knew how to survive in their time.

The problem is though, that this model doesn't really apply now. If someone makes a risky unsafe decision in their career today, chances are a predator won't eat them up. The worst that can happen is that they will fail, and probably will go back to another safe job. Thanks to thousands of years of evolution, we sure still carry the gene to crave for safety and that is why we struggle so much with ourselves when it's time to leave the safety net behind. This is also the reason why the few that do manage to take the leap also get rewarded heavily. 

And if you don't make it and go back to a safe-job, I promise you... you'll still get to procreate and pass on your genes. Moreover, you can take solace in the fact that hundreds of years from  now, when someone is writing about how evolution created their then current society of everyone loving what they were doing, he/she will perhaps give example of you as one of the first few primates who decided to take the leap.
