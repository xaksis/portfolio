#Overview

Recently a friend showed me a list of things he wanted to accomplish before he turned 30. I couldn't help but be utterly curious about it... It was such a simple yet brilliant idea! A list of exciting things that one would otherwise push off or be too lazy to do. Just the mere satisfaction of crossing them out one by one is reason enough to keep oneself motivated. Thus, I decided to create my own rolling 30 before 30 list...

# My List

1. ~~Learn how to swim~~ (May, 2012)
2. Swim 250m non-stop freestyle
3. [~~Jump from a plane and Freefall at 120 mph~~](freefall.html) (Sep 14, 2013)

14. Write a poem sitting in Stratford-Upon-Avon
