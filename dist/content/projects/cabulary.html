<p>While I was reading my Kindle on the subway the other day, I realized that one of the features I love about e-readers, is the ability to look up meanings of words right away. Thanks to me being the king of mediocre vocabulary, I use this feature very frequently. However, no matter what I try it is tough for me to retain the meaning of the word I just looked up a few days from now. </p>
<p>I was thinking, it would be so cool if Kindle automatically created flash cards of the words I looked up, so I could cycle through them at my leisure. Subways&#39; rhythmic track noise is always a great enabler for my runaway thoughts. Eventually, I endedup resolving to create something similar for browsers. </p>
<p>When I came home, I looked up how to create extensions for Chrome. Then I did some research looking into what dictionaries have a public APIs. Satisfied that this was doable, I sat down to code out <strong>Cabulary</strong>.  </p>

<p>Once you have added the extension to your Chrome</p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the word you want to add to your flashcard collection</li>
<li>Right click on it and choose - &#39;Add to Cabulary&#39;</li>
<li>Your flashcard will now be created and stored with the meaning of the highlighted word.</li>
</ol>
